Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time. 
We have decided as group to apply all that we have learned on our project, Wanderlust. By incorporating the knowledge and skills acquired, we aim to enhance the functionality and overall experience of Wanderlust, ensuring that it aligns with the best practices.

Project Idea 1: Music Recommendation System:
Develop a music recommendation system that suggests personalized playlists or songs based on user preferences. This project would involve utilizing machine learning algorithms, collaborative filtering, and content based recommendation techniques. You could gather data on users' listening habits, genre preferences, and feedback to train the recommendation model. The system could also incorporate features like mood based recommendations, discovery of new artists, and integration with popular music streaming platforms.

Project Idea 2:Intelligent Transportation System:
Create an intelligent transportation system that utilizes data analysis, machine learning, and real-time information to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve transportation efficiency. This project would involve collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as traffic cameras, GPS devices, and public transportation schedules. You could develop algorithms and models to predict traffic patterns, suggest optimal routes, and provide real-time traffic updates to users. Additionally, you could incorporate features like intelligent traffic signal control or smart parking management to further enhance the system's capabilities.
