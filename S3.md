# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## AWS S3

**1. What is Amazon S3?**

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to store and retrieve large amounts of data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications such as backup and restore, data archiving, content storage, and data analysis.

**2. Name some use cases for Amazon S3.**

* Data Backup and Restore
* Data Archiving
* Content Storage and Distribution
* Media Storage and Processing

**3. Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.**

* Scalability and Durability: S3 can store and retrieve virtually unlimited amounts of data with high durability and automatic replication for data integrity.

* Cost-Effectiveness: Different storage classes allow organizations to optimize storage costs based on their specific needs.

* Security: S3 provides robust security features, including encryption options and fine-grained access control policies.

* Ease of Use and Integration: S3 offers a user-friendly management console, APIs, and seamless integration with other AWS services.




## AWS Lambda Basics

**1. What is AWS Lambda?**

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you can focus on writing your application code and let AWS handle the underlying infrastructure and scaling.


**2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.**

* Serverless Web Applications
* Real-time File Processing
* Data Transformation
* Scheduled Tasks and Batch Processing


**3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.**

Serverless is often used for building scalable and flexible applications. It allows developers to focus more on writing code and delivering value to users, rather than spending time on server management and infrastructure concerns. It's like having a team of invisible servers that automatically handle your code and make sure it runs smoothly when needed.



## CDN

**1. What is a CDN?**

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a distributed network of servers located in different geographical locations around the world. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content, such as web pages, images, videos, or other files, to users with high performance and availability.


**2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?**

* Request Initiation: The website visitor initiates a request to access a specific webpage or content on the website. This can be done by typing the website URL in the browser, clicking on a link, or submitting a form.

* DNS Resolution: The visitor's browser sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to translate the website domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the CDN edge server closest to the visitor's location.

* Connection Establishment: The visitor's browser establishes a connection with the CDN edge server, which serves as the entry point to the CDN network. This connection is usually done over the internet via standard HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

* Content Delivery: The CDN edge server determines if it has the requested content in its cache. If the content is available in the cache and hasn't expired, the edge server directly serves the content to the visitor's browser, resulting in faster delivery with low latency.

* Cache Miss: If the CDN edge server does not have the requested content in its cache or if the content has expired, the edge server acts as a proxy and retrieves the content from the origin server (the website's main server).

* Content Caching: After retrieving the content from the origin server, the CDN edge server caches the content in its local cache. This helps accelerate subsequent requests for the same content from other visitors in the same geographical region.

* Content Delivery to Visitor: The CDN edge server delivers the requested content to the visitor's browser. The content is transmitted over the internet using the established connection, and the visitor's browser renders the content, displaying it on the screen.

* Optimizations and Dynamic Content: CDNs can also perform additional optimizations, such as compression, minification, and image resizing, to further enhance content delivery performance. Additionally, CDNs can handle dynamic content by acting as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic requests to the origin server and caching the response for subsequent requests.


**3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?**

employing a CDN brings faster and more reliable content delivery, improved website performance, reduced latency, global reach, scalability, cost savings, enhanced SEO, and DDoS protection.
