# Data Structures and Algorithms
1.What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
considering the operations you need to perform
2.How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
Make sure to define base cases correctly so that the recursive function reaches a point where it no longer calls itself
