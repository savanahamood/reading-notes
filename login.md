**1.What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?**
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of managing and controlling access to computer systems or network resources based on the roles and responsibilities of users within an organization. RBAC is a widely used access control model that enhances security by defining and enforcing permissions and privileges in a structured way.


**2.Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.**
an example of RBAC with corresponding roles and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a hypothetical content management system:

### Roles:

* Admin: This role has full control over the system and can perform all CRUD operations.
* Editor: Editors can create, read, and update content but cannot delete it.
* Viewer: Viewers can only read content but cannot make any changes.
* Guest: Guests have no access to the content management system.

### CRUD Operations and their associated permissions:

* Create:

Admin: Can create new content.
Editor: Can create new content.
Viewer: No permission to create content.
Guest: No permission to create content.

* Read:

Admin: Can read all content.
Editor: Can read all content.
Viewer: Can read all content.
Guest: Can read all content (publicly accessible content only).

* Update:

Admin: Can update all content.
Editor: Can update all content.
Viewer: No permission to update content.
Guest: No permission to update content.

*Delete:

Admin: Can delete all content.
Editor: No permission to delete content.
Viewer: No permission to delete content.
Guest: No permission to delete content.


**3.What are the Benefits of RBAC?**

1. Access Control: RBAC provides a structured approach to access control, ensuring that users only have access to the resources necessary for their roles. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

2. Simplicity: RBAC simplifies the management of access permissions by grouping users into roles. This makes it easier to assign and revoke access as user roles change.

3. Scalability: RBAC scales well with organizations as they grow. New users can be assigned to existing roles, and new roles can be created as needed.

**Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. Yes, they are similarly named react-cookie library react-cookies component.**

react-cookie is a comprehensive library for managing cookies in React applications, providing full control over creating, reading, updating, and deleting cookies. On the other hand, react-cookies is a smaller utility for reading cookie values and is primarily focused on cookie retrieval. Your choice between the two depends on your specific use case and whether you need full cookie management capabilities or just the ability to read cookie data in your React components.



**1.Describe some react-cookie features.**

* Easy Cookie Management: Simplifies working with cookies in React by abstracting complexities.

* React Hooks: Offers React hooks like useCookies for easy interaction with cookies in functional components.

* Cookie Creation: Allows creating cookies with various options like expiration time and security settings.

* Cookie Reading: Provides methods to easily read cookie values by name.

* Cookie Updating: Supports updating cookie values during a user's session.


**2.Describe some react-cookies features.**

* Simple API: react-cookies provides a simple and straightforward API for managing cookies in React applications.

* Get and Set Cookies: You can easily get and set cookies using methods like get, set, and remove.

* No Dependencies: react-cookies doesn't have any external dependencies, which can make it a lightweight choice.

* Cookie Options: You can specify additional options for cookies, such as expiration time and domain.

* No React-Specific Features: Unlike react-cookie, react-cookies doesn't offer React-specific hooks or components. It's a more general-purpose cookie management library.

**3.Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?**
react-cookie, preferred choice for managing cookies in React due to its seamless integration, support for server-side rendering, TypeScript support, and active community. It simplifies cookie management within the React ecosystem.
