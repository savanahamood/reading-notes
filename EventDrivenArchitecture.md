# Event Driven Architecture

**Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.** 

We have decided as group to apply all that we have learned on new project, Bidding. By incorporating the knowledge and skills acquired, we aim to enhance the functionality and overall experience of Bidding, ensuring that it aligns with the best practices.

Our Bidding project is a space for displaying items and their prices, allowing clients to raise the price, and the highest bidder will be the winner. We will use chat and notification system between the clients in our project


and we have other idea which is online store like amazon or shein where users can buy and sell products. The platform will include features such as search functionality, user profiles Implement a chat system to enable communication between buyers and sellers, allowing them to discuss product details, incorporate a notification system to send real-time updates to users
