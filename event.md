# Event Driven Applications

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is the events module Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.


2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
using Object-Oriented Programming OOP alongside Event Driven Programming EDP can lead to cleaner, modular, and more maintainable codebases. It allows you to leverage the benefits of both paradigms and build software systems that are flexible, extensible, and scalable.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
Event Driven Programming in the backend using Node.js is like having a team of efficient workers in a restaurant, where each worker can handle multiple customers' orders simultaneously without any delays. This approach helps ensure your website can handle many requests at once and respond quickly to your customers, making it a great choice for building scalable and responsive web applications.
