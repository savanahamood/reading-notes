# Graphs

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Each edge represents a relationship between two nodes. Graphs can be used to model a wide range of scenarios, such as networks, social connections, maps, and more.

### Types of Graphs:

1. Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a specific direction. An edge from node A to node B indicates a one-way connection.
2. Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction. The connection between nodes A and B is bidirectional.
3. Weighted Graph: Edges have weights or costs associated with them. For example, in a map, weights could represent distances between cities.
4. Unweighted Graph: Edges have no associated weights.

### Graph key

* Nodes (Vertices): These are the entities represented in the graph.
* Edges: These connect pairs of nodes and represent relationships.
* Adjacency: Nodes connected by an edge are adjacent to each other.
* Degree of a Node: The number of edges connected to a node.
* Path: A sequence of nodes where each node is connected to the next by an edge.
* Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same node.
* Connected Graph: Every node is reachable from any other node.
* Disconnected Graph: Consists of multiple connected components.


### Graph Representation:
Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where cell (i, j) indicates whether there's an edge from node i to node j. Adjacency List: An array of linked lists where each node's list contains its adjacent nodes.

Graphs provide a way to model and solve real-world problems involving relationships and connections. They are used in various applications, including:

Social networks: Modeling friendships and connections. Transportation systems: Modeling roads, flights, or train routes. Computer networks: Modeling connections between devices. Recommendation systems: Suggesting friends, products, or content.

### In Conclusion:
Graphs are a powerful and versatile data structure that enable us to represent and analyze relationships between entities. Their ability to capture interconnectedness makes them a fundamental tool in computer science and various real-world scenarios.
