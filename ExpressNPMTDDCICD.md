# Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD
An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1.Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
Middleware is a software layer between the web server and the application it has the ability to modify the request or response before they reach their final destination. It can add or remove information, transform data, or even stop the request from proceeding if something goes wrong.

2.Express the most popular __ __ ____.
Express is the most popular Node.js framework.

3.Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
it's flexible framework that allows developers to make their own choices regarding the structure, design, and implementation of their web applications.

4.What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
A module is a JavaScript library that you can import into other code it allows developers to break down complex systems into manageable parts, making the development process more efficient.



What is NPM?
1.What version of npm are you running on your machine? 9.5.0
2.What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project? npm install jshint

What is TDD?
1.Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
tests are important because they help us ensure the quality of our code check if it is doing what it's supposed to do.

2.What are three expected benefits of testing
*reduction in defect rates
*reduction in effort in later phases
*improved design qualities

3.Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
*partial adoption of testing practices
*poor maintenance of the test suite

CI/CD
1.What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
*more test reliability
*easy update code
*improved collaboration and communication when ensures that everyone is working on the latest version of the code

2.What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
Continuous Delivery focuses on keeping the software in a releasable state but requires human intervention to initiate the deployment process
Continuous Deployment takes automation a step further by automatically deploying code changes without any human intervention

3.Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
using github make it easier to enables developers to work together, manage code changes, review code, and automate the testing and deployment processes using CI or CD
